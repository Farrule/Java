# Ostle Project  

This project aims to turn a board game called Ostle into a window application.

## Description

This window application is designed to be played by two people, similar to the board game Ostle that we referred to.  
The basic rules are also implemented so that they are the same as the actual Ostle.

## Usage

### Execution method

```
java -jar Ostle.jar
```

### Method of operation

On the first Start screen, left-click the button to go to the game screen.  
On the game screen, you can move the cursor with the WASD key or the arrow keys and select a piece with the space key.  
When you select a piece, the text at the bottom of the screen changes to push mode.  
In push mode, you can input in the same way as the previous operation method, and you can move the piece in the input direction.
